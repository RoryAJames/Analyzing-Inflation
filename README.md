# Analyzing Inflation and The S&P 500

This is a working repo for the purpose of analyzing inflation and its impact on the earnings and price to earnings ratio of the S&P 500.

The goals of this project are to:

- Build a regression model that assess and predicts the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 using inflation as the independent variable.
  
- Assess what reasonable earnings growth assumptions are for the S&P 500.

- Allow a user to calculate where they think the S&P 500 will be at the end of the year based on their inputs of inflation and earnings growth.
